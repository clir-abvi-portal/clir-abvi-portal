# Religious Leaders of Central Iowa, 1900-1930 Individual Vignettes 

Faith traditions and churches played a central role in the creation of communities in the United States. In the 1840s and early 1850s Black communities developed in eastern Iowa, especially in Muscatine and Keokuk. Early on African Methodist Episcopal (AME) congregations organized in those cities. By 1852 an African Methodist Episcopal congregation was meeting in Muscatine and Keokuk also had an AME congregation. The presence of Black religious groups in these communities is unsurprising as Lee County led the state with 245 Black residents and Muscatine County was second with 112 Black residents in 1860. 

After the Civil War, Iowa’s Black population grew from 5,762 in 1870 to 9,516 in 1880. As coal mining began to play a major role in Iowa’s economy in the late 1800s the Black population  continued to increase. Iowa’s Black population reached a pre-World War II peak of 19,005 in 1920. It is in the period 1900 - 1930 where Black Baptist and Methodist religious congregations were in large and small communities across the southern half of the state including Taylor and Page Counties in southwest Iowa, Jasper, Polk and Boone Counties in the central part of the state, as well as the eastern counties of Scott, Muscatine, Des Moines, and Lee. Mahaska and Wapello Counties also had active Black churches. Congregations of various denominations also existed in Waterloo, Mason City, Cedar Rapids, and Sioux City.

This period of review is also when the Iowa State Bystander newspaper became a vital source of information for the Black community in Iowa and neighboring states. Publisher John L. Thompson had correspondents in various cities and towns. THe newspaper provided important insights into the men and women who served religious functions in Iowa. It along with governmental records, city directories, and other primary sources provided biographical information to shed light on these overlooked figures in Iowa, regional, and national history..
