## Iowa State University
Iowa State University Library supports a public land-grant university of over 30,000 students. Library collections serve the academic and research needs of the university, reflected in its seven colleges (not including the Graduate College): Agriculture and Life Sciences, Business, Design, Engineering, Health and Human Sciences, Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Veterinary Medicine. Iowa State University served as the lead institution on the grant, and hosts the portal. Library staff oversaw the administration of the grant, created metadata guidelines for grant partners, provided digitization and conservation work and advice, created the portal, and contributed content.
